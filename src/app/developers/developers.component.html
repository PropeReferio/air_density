        <p>I'd like to explain the purpose of this app to developers, which is
readily apparent to skydivers, but probably not to those in the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>Obviously, many skydivers are adrenaline junkies. A skydive lasts
about 4 minutes, costs $25, and as such, skydivers want to squeeze all the fun
they can out of it.
        </p>
        <p>In our first jumps, we're advised not to make low turns, as this 
causes the parachute to dive at the ground... But the experts know that the 
<strong>perfect</strong> low turn generates lots of speed for the landing,
resulting in a surf across the grass that can't be explained with words.
        </p>
        <p>Of course... this can go <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">
terribly wrong</span>. The parachute must come out of the dive at the right 
moment, or you can hit the ground with <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold">
lethal force</span>.
        </p>
        <p>This app provides a metric, Density Altitude, which represents how
thick or thin the air is. As the air density <span style="font-weight: bold;">
changes from day to day and even throughout the day</span>, the same dive can 
recover too quickly... or too late, resulting in injury or death.
        </p>
        <p>By making this metric accessible, skydivers are better informed to 
make these high performance landings in a more calculated way, without relying
too much on feel.
        </p>
        <h1>How the App works</h1>
        <p>This app was built with Angular. It makes an API call, takes
data from the JSON, stores those in variables, and crunches the numbers in a
formula to get Density Altitude. The DOM is modified by Angular directives, 
and the results come out on the home page. The numbers update by the minute,
providing up to date data (many aviation data sources update every 4-6 hours).
I believe this app is the best, one-tap result available to skydivers today.
